The Shin Megami Tensei Alice shares many physical similarities with the character, most notably the blue dress and the blonde hair.\n\n    However, some say that she is also based on a myth of an Aryan girl who died at a young age. When Alice died and became a spirit, she gained extreme magical power that drove her insane. Alice was used to scare Scandinavian children into behaving, or else Alice would visit them at night and kill them so that she may become \"friends\" with them. Due to the overwhelming support of both theories, it is easy to assume both are valid and that she is a hybrid of both figures.

She famously relates to the tale of the missing sun deity, Amaterasu.\n\n    Amaterasu's brother, the storm god Susano-o, had vandalized her sacred buildings and brutally killed one of her maidens because she refused to trust him. In turn, Amaterasu became terrified of his wrath and retreated into a cave. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.\n    \n    The clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.\n    \n    Amaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.\n    \n    At that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat.

Many men came to ask for her hand in marriage but she refused them all. Eventually the Emperor of Japan also heard of her beauty and desired to marry her. She refused him as well, however, he still continued to love her even though they never married.\n\nEventually it was revealed that she was from a group of celestial people who lived on the moon. When they came to take her back, the Emperor sent guards to protect her to no avail. Before she was brought back to the moon, Kaguya gave the Emperor a small portion of the Elixir of Life to grant him immortality for his kindness. But due to his distraught at Kaguya\'s passing, the Emperor did not want to live forever without her. He ordered a messenger to take the elixir to the top of the highest mountain in the land and burn it. This mountain was Mt. Fuji and it is believed to be a possible cause for the name of the mountain. In different kanji 不死 can be read as "Fushi" or "Fuji" which would mean "immortal." However the kanji used today for the mountain are different, (富士）.\n',origins:["Japanese"]},{name:"Magatsu-Izanagi",history:'Magatsu-Izanagi (禍津伊弉諾) means "Calamity Izanagi."

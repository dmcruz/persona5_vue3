The character Alice herself is said to be taken from Alice Pleasance Liddell, a little girl who was close to Carroll. The Shin Megami Tensei Alice shares many physical similarities with the character, most notably the blue dress and the blonde hair.\n\n    However, some say that she is also based on a myth of an Aryan girl who died at a young age. When Alice died and became a spirit, she gained extreme magical power that drove her insane. Alice was used to scare Scandinavian children into behaving, or else Alice would visit them at night and kill them so that she may become \"friends\" with them. Due to the overwhelming support of both theories, it is easy to assume both are valid and that she is a hybrid of both figures. That both are valid seems to be the case though, since the Strange Journey compendium hints at both.\n    \n    `,\n    origins: ['British', 'Scandinavian', 'Modern Fiction'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Alilat',\n    history: `Al-Lat, also known as Allat, Alilat and Allatu, was one of three main idols alongside al-'Uzza and al-Manat worshipped by the people of Mecca before the message of Islam was spread by the prophet Muhammad. Its origins are traced from the traditions of Sumerian civilization brought to pre-Islamic Arabia by merchants and nomads who idolized stones in their daily life.\n\n    In one instance, it is regarded as a goddess, and had a son Dusura, who was idolized by the people of Petra in ancient Jordan. Alilat is associated with the morning star, which is also associated with Venus.`,\n    origins: ['Arabian'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Ame-no-Uzume',\n    history: `Ame no Uzume is the goddess of dawn and revelry in the Shinto religion of Japan. She famously relates to the tale of the missing sun deity, Amaterasu.\n\n    Amaterasu's brother, the storm god Susano-o, had vandalized her sacred buildings and brutally killed one of her maidens because she refused to trust him. In turn, Amaterasu became terrified of his wrath and retreated into a cave. The world, without the illumination of the sun, became dark and the gods could not lure Amaterasu out of her hiding place.\n    \n    The clever Uzume overturned a tub near the cave entrance and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other deities. They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.\n    \n    Amaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.\n    \n    At that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance. The deities Ame-no-Koyane and Ame-no-Futodama then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine. She agreed, and light was restored to the earth.`,\n\n    origins: ['Japanese'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Ananta',\n    history: `Shesha, also known as Ananta, is the king of all nagas according to Hindu mythology and one of the primal beings of creation. He is sometimes called Ananta Shesha which means \"Endless Shesha\" as he is said to hold all the planets in the universe on his hoods. He is usually depicted as a massive coiled serpent with as many as five to one thousand heads, sometimes wearing an ornate crown on each head. The heads are not only venomous but spew fire as well. He was born from the mouth of the sleeping Balarama (sun god's brother) where he devoured all but Balarama's head.\n\n    Shesha is used by Vishnu as a bed, and he is often found sleeping upon his back. Shesha will also constantly be found singing about the glories of Vishnu from all his many mouths.\n    \n    One story of Shesha tells of when he challenged the devas, claiming that only the great Hindu Triad could defeat him. Only the god of wind, Vayu, accepted his challenge. Shesha wrapped himself around a large mountain and told Vayu that he would be the winner should he destroy the mountain. Vayu created powerful storms, but Shesha simply enlarged himself and swallowed up the storms. Vayu, weakened from his attempts to defeat Shesha, was overpowered and swallowed by the serpent causing all living things to lose the ability to breathe. Luckily Vishnu told Shesha to release Vayu, Shesha obeyed, and in doing so the mountain he was wrapped around instantly crumbled.\n    \n    At the end of each Kalpa (time period allotted to the earth), the serpent destroys all creation.`,\n\n    origins: ['Hindu'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Andras',\n    history: 'According to the writings in The Lesser Key of Solomon, Andras is the sixty-third demonic spirit listed in the Ars Goetia.

He is depicted as a humanoid with an angel\\'s wings and an owl\\'s head, riding a black wolf and holding a bright sword. Among the spirits of the Goetia, Andras is one of the most violent and dangerous to summon. The conjurer and any attendants he may have must stay within a magic circle at all times no matter how much Andras tempts them to leave it, or he will surely kill them. He is able to control a person\\'s anger or inflict rage upon any person the conjurer desires and tempt people to kill their servants or masters. If so asked, Andras will gladly kill any person the conjurer desires, and in certain demonology it is suggested that Flauros is his servant.',\n    origins: ['Ars Goetia'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Angel',\n    history: `Angels are divine celestial beings that have been recorded in various religious lore, mainly Abrahamic, who faithfully serve God.

Should the heart be heavier than the feather, the heart would be eaten by Ammut, and the person undergoing judgement was not allowed to continue their voyage towards Osiris and immortality.\n    `,\n    origins: ['Egyptian'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Anzu',\n    history: 'Anzu, mainly known as Zu, was a demonic tempest bird in Mesopotamian mythology, known for stealing the Tablet of Destinies from Enlil, the lord of the wind.

There are many kings and rulers of the Asura, but one major Asura Lord is based on Virocana, also known as Maha Vairocana or Dainichi Nyorai, the king of the asuras who, alongside Indra, searched for the secret of enlightenment.\n    \n    In Buddhism, they are the lowest rank of deities and are jealous gods addicted to various malign passions, while said to be one of the four unhappy births, being representative of a human being incapable of peace and always angered with the world, while also seeking strife and violence. In Japanese Buddhism, they are demigods, or semi-blessed beings. Powerful protectors of Buddhism, yet fierce and quarrelsome, they are partly good and partly evil, like humans. Their realm is believed to be a world of strife said to be located on the ocean floor. Some say Ashura was an Indian royal who converted to Buddhism. In other traditions, Ashura was a sun goddess who was feared for bringing droughts. The leaders of the Asuras were called Asurinda or Asurendra (\"Asura Lord\"). The principal leaders are Vemacritin (also called Vepacitti), Rahu (also called Veroca, Verocana, or Virocana) and Paharada. The appearance of the Megami Tensei series' Asura is most likely based on the Japanese Buddhist depiction of the Asuras.\n    \n    However, in Zoroastrianism, Asura is known as Ahura, and are depicted as the forces of good, led by Ahura Mazda. In fact, the Indo-Iranians, the term asura (or in this case ahura) originally referred to divine beings on par with the gods. After the Aryans went their separate ways from the Iranians, the asuras came to be seen as rival gods, eventually even demonic. The struggle between the devas and the asuras possibly reflects the conflict between the tribes who worshiped a pantheon led by the god Indra and the tribes who worshiped the gods called the asuras.`,\n    origins: ['Hindu', 'Buddhist', 'Zoroastrian', 'Vedic'],\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Atavaka',\n    history: 'Atavaka (\"lord of the forest\" in Sanskrit), or Daigensui Myo-O (大元帥明王) in Japanese, used to be a child-eating demon until he received Buddha\\'s enlightenment.

Her Roman equivalent was Morta. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she and her sisters (Lachesis and Clotho) are the daughters of Nyx and Erebus. In other accounts, they are said to be the daughters of Zeus and Themis as well as several other beings such as Chaos and Ananke.\n    \n    Atropos , along with her sisters and Hermes, was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people, forced the goddess Aphrodite into making love with other beings, weakened the monster Typhon with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with lightning, and even aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Even though Atropos and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology.\n    \n    She is the most known sister, due to her job. Atropos was the smallest in stature, but the oldest and some believe, more powerful and cruel. Once those ends are cut by her razor sharp scissors, it is impossible to tie them back together.

Attis arrived at the site of a pine tree, castrated himself and died. The pine tree protected his spirit, while Zeus and Cybele worked to keep his body from rotting.

While it can actually refer to a large number of different deities, Baal in this case refers to Hadad, the Canaan god of rain, fertility, agriculture and thunder who is also one of the King of the Gods in the Canaanite pantheon. He was worshipped in many ancient Middle Eastern communities. As Hadad he was represented as a bearded deity, often holding a club and thunderbolt and wearing a horned headdress. The bull was the symbolic animal of Hadad, as of the Hittite deity Teshub, who was identical with him.\n\n    The name Baal, or Ba'al, is used as a substitute in some texts and in common modern usage. This is probably derived from the fact that, in ancient Canaan, only priests were allowed to utter the divine name, in much the same way as in Judaism where only priests were allowed to utter the name of God, so common people simply referred to him as Baal.\n    \n    The word ba'al was also used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to any number of local spirit deities worshiped as cult images, and in this context they were each regarded as false gods.

When Shiva came and wished to see his wife, Ganesha refused, which infuriated Shiva. The two battled until Shiva in his anger cut off Ganesha's head. When Parvati saw what Shiva had done, he apologized and hastily searched for a new head. He took the first head he saw, which was that of an elephant, and placed it on Ganesha's shoulders. In some versions of this story, Ganesha already had an elephant's head, and it was at this point that Shiva threw his trident and broke off one of his tusks.\n    \n    In another story, Parvati was so proud of her newborn son that she invited all the other devas to a feast so that they may see how perfect and handsome he was. Among the guests was Parvati's brother Shani, who was cursed with the evil eye. When he looked upon Ganesha his head was instantly burned to ashes. Luckily Brahma was present and agreed that he would allow Ganesha to live if the head of the first creature that was found was placed on his shoulders.

The tale surrounding this is that she proceeded to take her revenge by killing off half the kingdom, which by then belonged to her and Dharmodayana's son Erlangga, with plague before being overcome by a holy man.

In the Book of Job and the Kabbalah in particular, Satan is even able to take control of the life of a person in the stead of God, though only to the extent which God allows.\n\n    In contrast, the New Testament depicts Satan as a rebel and an opposer to the will of God. In the Gospels, he is shown trying to tempt Christ away from the role of messiah, and Jesus denounced Satan as the father of lies. The Book of Revelation later names Satan as the devil leading an army of angels into a war with Michael and the rest of heaven. \n    \n    Regardless of which interpretation is the case, Satan often appears to those who are sinful, playing into their hearts and towing them into despair and further sin. In Islam, he is regarded as an instrument of God's wrath, and several classifications of demons also associate Satan with Wrath of the seven deadly sins.\n    \n    In modern Christianity and literature with Abrahamic influence, Satan is typically considered one of the many names or titles referring to the devil in Christianity, who rallied other angels against the authority of God, after which they fought against the forces of God, were utterly defeated and then cast down into hell, becoming demons. Megami Tensei does not depict Satan as the devil (the role goes to Lucifer in Megami Tensei), instead based on Satan's appearance in the Book of Job.\n    \n    Throughout history, Satan's figure has been linked with other dark entities from mythology, such as Seth, Hades, Ahriman and Mara, while some other religious currents such as Gnosticism portray him as the evil deity Yaldabaoth.
